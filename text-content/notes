* What are headings?
.Headings define importance and structure of content.

HTML provides 6 heading levels:
. <h1> to <h6>
. <h1> → most important
. <h6> → least important

Use only one <h1> per page

Do not skip levels
❌ h1 → h3
✅ h1 → h2 → h3

Don’t use headings just to make text big

🔹 What is a paragraph?
A paragraph represents a block of text.

HTML tag:
<p>

🔹 Important behavior of <p>
Browser automatically adds margin
Extra spaces & new lines are ignored
Text wraps automatically

🔹 Line breaks vs paragraphs
<p> → new block
<br> → new line inside same block

3️⃣ formatting.html
This is where text styling + meaning comes in.

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT:
Some tags are visual, some are semantic.

🔹 Visual vs Semantic (KEY CONCEPT)
Visual	Semantic
<b>	<strong>
<i>	<em>

Semantic tags tell meaning, not just appearance.
